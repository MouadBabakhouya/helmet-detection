## 🌟 Overview
After weeks of work, I’m excited to present my **AI-powered traffic violation detection system**.  
It leverages **YOLOv8** for **helmet detection** and **EasyOCR** for **license plate recognition**, enabling real-time monitoring of roads, logging violations, and producing actionable data for safety enforcement.

This system can be deployed for:
- **Road Safety Authorities** → Automatically detect and record violations.
- **Logistics Companies** → Monitor driver compliance.
- **Government Agencies** → Generate revenue from fines while improving safety.

## ✨ Features
✅ Real-time **helmet violation detection**.  
✅ Automatic **license plate recognition**.  
✅ **Violation logging** in CSV (plate, time, evidence image).  
✅ Works with **images and videos**.  
✅ Easily integrable into **CCTV or traffic camera systems**.
